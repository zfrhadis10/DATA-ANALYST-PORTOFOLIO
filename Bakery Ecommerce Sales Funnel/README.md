> **Data-Driven Strategy to Reduce Friction and Maximize Conversion Rates**

## 📌 Project Overview

## 🚀 Key Insights & Business Impact
*   **Identified Critical Bottleneck:** Pinpointed a significant **40% user drop-off** occurring between the 'Delivery Info' and 'Confirm Payment' stages.
*   **Conversion Optimization:** Analyzed the high **90% "Add to Cart" rate**, highlighting strong product appeal but a major failure in the final transaction phase.
*   **Strategic Metric Analysis:** Differentiated between **Actionable Metrics** (Drop-off rates) and **Vanity Metrics** (Total Traffic) to focus on data that drives actual business growth.
