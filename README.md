# Zafirah Aida Adista - Data Analyst Portofolio

## About Me
Hi, I’m Zafirah! I have an academic background in Nanotechnology Engineering with strong experience in laboratory work. I am currently focusing on and developing my interest in the field of Data Analytics with a growing interest in transforming data into meaningful and actionable insights.

Through my academic projects, I have worked extensively with experimental data, data documentation, and basic statistical analysis. These experiences have strengthened my analytical thinking, attention to detail, and ability to work with structured data—skills that are highly relevant in data analyst roles.

At present, I am actively improving my technical skills in data analysis, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I enjoy exploring new analytical tools and applying them to real-world datasets through hands-on projects. I am motivated by turning raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

In this portfolio, I have included a collection of projects that showcase my skills and learning progress in data analytics. You will find links to dashboards and reports created using tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. These projects highlight my ability to analyze data and present insights in a clear, structured, and visually engaging way to support data-driven decision-making.

I have also included projects involving Python and SQL, where I work with structured datasets to perform data cleaning, analysis, and basic statistical exploration. Through these projects, I demonstrate my ability to extract meaningful insights from data and integrate information from multiple sources to build a comprehensive understanding of the problem.

 I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.
