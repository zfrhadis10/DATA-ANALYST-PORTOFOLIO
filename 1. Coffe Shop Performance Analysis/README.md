## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]Analyzed coffee shop sales data using **SQL** to identify key performance metrics and trends across various store locations during the 2025 operational period. [cite_start]This project transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights, focusing on product performance, customer behavior, and sales patterns[cite: 7]. Additionally, a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** was developed to provide real-time visibility into business performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory and marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* [cite_start]**Evaluate Sales Performance**: Identify top-performing products like the Coffee and Tea categories to understand revenue drivers[cite: 10, 16].
* [cite_start]**Analyze Customer Behavior**: Determine peak transaction hours (07:00–10:00 AM) and purchasing habits, such as the average basket size of 1–2 items per transaction[cite: 25, 32].
* [cite_start]**Optimize Operational Efficiency**: Pinpoint underperforming products like Green Beans and Organic Chocolate to streamline inventory and reduce costs[cite: 15, 39].
* [cite_start]**Strategic Growth**: Provide data-backed recommendations, such as "Morning Rush" bundles and location-specific upselling strategies[cite: 44, 48].
* **Data Visualization**: Create an interactive dashboard to monitor daily revenue, transaction volume, and average order value (AOV) across all branches.

## 📊 Key Insights from SQL Analysis
* [cite_start]**Top Products**: **Coffee** and **Tea** consistently sell above the average unit per category, with **Latte** and **Earl Grey Rg** being the most popular specific items[cite: 11, 13].
* [cite_start]**High-Performing Locations**: **Hell's Kitchen** leads in total transactions and revenue, while **Lower Manhattan** records the highest average spend per transaction[cite: 17, 20].
* [cite_start]**Peak Hours**: A sharp spike in transactions occurs between **07:00 – 10:00 AM**, with the highest revenue recorded at 10:00 AM[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Sales Trends**: Weekdays (Monday - Friday) show higher transaction volumes and revenue compared to weekends[cite: 28].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Database**: PostgreSQL (Data cleaning, aggregation, and trend analysis).
* **Visualization**: Power BI (Interactive dashboards and KPI tracking).
* [cite_start]**Documentation**: Microsoft PDF (Executive Summary)[cite: 1].

## 💡 Recommendations
1. [cite_start]**Menu Optimization**: Consider delisting 18 underperforming product types to reduce storage costs and waste[cite: 14, 39].
2. [cite_start]**Upselling Strategy**: Leverage **Sugar-free Syrup** as a high-value add-on for other coffee drinks[cite: 40].
3. [cite_start]**Operational Focus**: Improve service speed in Hell's Kitchen to handle massive morning volumes and prevent long queues[cite: 42, 43].
4. [cite_start]**Saturday Specials**: Launch "Saturday Family Packages" to boost volume on the day with the highest spend per transaction but lowest total traffic[cite: 50].
